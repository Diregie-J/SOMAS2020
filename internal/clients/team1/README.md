# Strategy
## Foraging

Assumptions
* Total resources out are proportional to total contributions
* There is an upper limit to a hunt's rewards
* Number of participants does not matter for total utility, only total
  contribution matters
* We don't know the split of resources to contributors
* There is a population of deer that changes depending on hunting intensity
